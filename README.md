We proposed DEFN, a 3D OCT segmentation network for eye diseases with unobvious characteristics and easy to be interfered with, such as macular hole and macular edema.

This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation for DEFN networking and DWC Loss, as well as the pre-trained model for DEFN.
